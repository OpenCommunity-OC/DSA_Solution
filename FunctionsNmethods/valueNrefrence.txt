 Pass by Value (Primitive Types):
When you pass a primitive type (e.g., int, float, boolean) to a method, a copy of the actual value is passed.
Changes made to the parameter inside the method do not affect the original value outside the method.


Pass by Value (Reference to Objects):
When you pass an object (non-primitive type) to a method, the reference to the object is passed by value.
This means the method receives a copy of the reference, and changes made to the object's state inside the method are reflected outside the method.
